			  	<p> Universal Healthcare is a form of medical coverage that allows all people no matter their gender, race, income, etc. It usually includes most healthcare services that would be included in a normal paid healthcare system. 43 countries currently have a universal healthcare coverage system in place.  </p>

					  <p> In America, many citizens are not informed about Universal Healthcare and what it does for a country and its occupants. Out of 2,000 Amercians, only 4% can correctly identify the 4 main terms of health insurance.                       A country's citizens not being informed means that there are many debates going around on whether or not it should be established in America. Until then the country has no form of healthcare for all and that can be a bad thing in the long run from an economical and social point of view.</p>

			  	<p>There are multiple approaches to educating the mass american populous on universal healthcare and how it can help them achieve a better society and economy. Providing statistics that highlight the effects implementation of this coverage system provides towards other countries is a start, as it can be used as a comparison of where America can be at. Informing americans about the in's and out's of a Universal Healthcare coverage system could also help as well as using pros and cons to back it up.</p>

As soon as possible educating Americans is the most important thing that needs to be done and is the goal now, but over the years we want to obtain a point where we American citizens can understand Universal Healthcare to a point where it can be implemented into our modern society leading into eventual economic and social changes.</p>
